My name is Martin Ayon and I'm a UX Designer? UI Engineer? Full Stack Engineer? Web Master? All of the above? Hard to say these days but I've been doing all of that since the early 90's

I'm based in Orange County, California and I'm a firm believer that sharing knowledge is the best way to help each other.

I provide design and web development services at [960 Studios](https://www.960studios.com) and I've just started a new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MartinAyon) where I share web development & design tutorials, career advice, opinions, etc.
